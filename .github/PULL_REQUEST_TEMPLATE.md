to make the process easy and effective for everyone involved.

**You must open an issue** before embarking on any significant pull request, especially those that
add a new code or change existing tests, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working

- [ ] You only changed necessary files (commits with formatting only changes will be reject, see below)
- [ ] Documentation is updated (if necessary)
- [ ] Description explains the issue/use-case resolved and auto-closes related issues
- [ ] **IMPORTANT** You have executed the format_code.bat batch in the root of your fork to format the code with qlnet standard.

Be kind to code reviewers, please try to keep pull requests as small and focused as possible :)
