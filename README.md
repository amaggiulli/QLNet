## Development workflow 

###### QLNet use git flow workflow.

Instead of a single master branch, this workflow uses two branches to record the history of the project. 
The *master* branch stores the official release history, and the *develop* branch serves as an integration branch for features.
The *develop* branch will also contain the complete history of the project.

###### Features 

To contribute features, you should clone the repository, create a tracking branch for develop and create the feature:

```
git clone https://github.com/amaggiulli/qlnet.git
git checkout -b develop origin/develop
git checkout -b some-feature develop
```

When the feature is ready, you can make a pull request to merge that feature into *develop*. 
Note that features will never be merged directly into *master*.

###### Releases

When a release is ready, we fork a release branch from *develop*. Creating this branch starts the next release cycle, 
so no new features can be added after this point; only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks go in this branch. 
Once it's ready to ship, the release gets merged into *master* and tagged with a version number. 

###### HotFix

Maintenance or “hotfix” branches are used to quickly patch production releases. This is the only branch that fork directly off of *master*. 
As soon as the fix is complete, it will be merged into both *master* and *develop*, and *master* will be tagged with an updated version number.
