      // the current date of a given number of business days; and
      // the third is that it is based on the reference date of
      // some other structure.
      // 
      // In the first case, the constructor taking a date is to be
      // used; the default implementation of referenceDate() will
      // then return such date. In the second case, the constructor
      // taking a number of days and a calendar is to be used;
      // referenceDate() will return a date calculated based on the
      // current evaluation date, and the term structure and its
      // observers will be notified when the evaluation date
      // changes. In the last case, the referenceDate() method must
      // be overridden in derived classes so that it fetches and
      // return the appropriate date.
