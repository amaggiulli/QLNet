   //! A transformation of an existing inflation swap rate.
   /*! This is an abstract class and contains the functions
       correctXXXRate which returns rates with the seasonality
       correction.  Currently only the price multiplicative version
       is implemented, but this covers stationary (1-year) and
       non-stationary (multi-year) seasonality depending on how many
       years of factors are given.  Seasonality is piecewise
       constant, hence it will work with un-interpolated inflation
       indices.

       A seasonality assumption can be used to fill in inflation swap
       curves between maturities that are usually given in integer
       numbers of years, e.g. 8,9,10,15,20, etc.  Historical
       seasonality may be observed in reported CPI values,
       alternatively it may be affected by known future events, e.g.
       announced changes in VAT rates.  Thus seasonality may be
       stationary or non-stationary.

       If seasonality is additive then both swap rates will show
       affects.  Additive seasonality is not implemented.

          inflation curve base date should be the same or else there
          can be an inconsistency with quoted instruments.

   /*! Stationary multiplicative seasonality in CPI/RPI/HICP (i.e. in
     price) implies that zero inflation swap rates are affected,
     but that year-on-year inflation swap rates show no effect.  Of
     course, if the seasonality in CPI/RPI/HICP is non-stationary
     then both swap rates will be affected.

     Factors must be in multiples of the minimum required for one
     year, e.g. 12 for monthly, and these factors are reused for as
     long as is required, i.e. they wrap around.  So, for example,
     if 24 factors are given this repeats every two years.  True
     stationary seasonality can be obtained by giving the same
     number of factors as the frequency dictates e.g. 12 for
     monthly seasonality.

     \warning Multi-year seasonality (i.e. non-stationary) is
              fragile: the user <b>must</b> ensure that corrections
              at whole years before and after the inflation term
              structure base date are the same.  Otherwise there
              can be an inconsistency with quoted rates.  This is
              enforced if the frequency is lower than daily.  This
              is not enforced for daily seasonality because this
              will always be inconsistent due to weekends,
              holidays, leap years, etc.  If you use multi-year
              daily seasonality it is up to you to check.

     \note Factors are normalized relative to their appropriate
           reference dates.  For zero inflation this is the
           inflation curve true base date: since you have a fixing
           for that date the seasonality factor must be one.  For
           YoY inflation the reference is always one year earlier.

     Seasonality is treated as piecewise constant, hence it works
     correctly with uninterpolated indices if the seasonality
     correction factor frequency is the same as the index frequency
     (or less).
