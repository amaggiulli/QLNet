        - the correctness of the returned value is tested by
          reproducing results available in literature.
        - the correctness of the returned greeks is tested by
          reproducing results available in literature.
        - the correctness of the returned greeks is tested by
          reproducing numerical derivatives.
        - the correctness of the returned implied volatility is tested
          by using it for reproducing the target value.
        - the implied-volatility calculation is tested by checking
          that it does not modify the option.
        - the correctness of the returned value in case of
          cash-or-nothing digital payoff is tested by reproducing
          results available in literature.
        - the correctness of the returned value in case of
          asset-or-nothing digital payoff is tested by reproducing
          results available in literature.
        - the correctness of the returned value in case of gap digital
          payoff is tested by reproducing results available in
          literature.
