		with the specific relevant underlying (e.g. bond, stock, commodity, loan/deposit). These functions must be used to set the
		protected member variables underlyingSpotValue_ and underlyingIncome_ within performCalculations() in the derived
		class before the base-class implementation is called.

		spotIncome() refers generically to the present value of coupons, dividends or storage costs.

		discountCurve_ is the curve used to discount forward contract cash flows back to the evaluation day, as well as to obtain
		forward values for spot values/prices.

		incomeDiscountCurve_, which for generality is not automatically set to the discountCurve_, is the curve used to
		discount future income/dividends/storage-costs etc back to the evaluation date.
