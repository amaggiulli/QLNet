   //! %Forward rate agreement (FRA) class
   /*! 1. Unlike the forward contract conventions on carryable
          financial assets (stocks, bonds, commodities), the
          valueDate for a FRA is taken to be the day when the forward
          loan or deposit begins and when full settlement takes place
          (based on the NPV of the contract on that date).
          maturityDate is the date when the forward loan or deposit
          ends. In fact, the FRA settles and expires on the
          valueDate, not on the (later) maturityDate. It follows that
          (maturityDate - valueDate) is the tenor/term of the
          underlying loan or deposit

       2. Choose position type = Long for an "FRA purchase" (future
          long loan, short deposit [borrower])

       3. Choose position type = Short for an "FRA sale" (future short
          loan, long deposit [lender])

       4. If strike is given in the constructor, can calculate the NPV
          of the contract via NPV().

       5. If forward rate is desired/unknown, it can be obtained via
          forwardRate(). In this case, the strike variable in the
          constructor is irrelevant and will be ignored.

       <b>Example: </b>
       \link FRA.cs
       valuation of a forward-rate agreement
       \endlink

       \todo Add preconditions and tests

       \todo Should put an instance of ForwardRateAgreement in the
             FraRateHelper to ensure consistency with the piecewise
             yield curve.

       \todo Differentiate between BBA (British)/AFB (French)
             [assumed here] and ABA (Australian) banker conventions
             in the calculations.

       \warning This class still needs to be rigorously tested
