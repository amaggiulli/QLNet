   /*! \brief Parallel evolver for multiple arrays

       This class takes the evolver class and creates a new class which evolves
       each of the evolvers in parallel.  Part of what this does is to take the
       types for each evolver class and then wrapper them so that they create
       new types which are sets of the old types.

       This class is intended to be run in situations where there are parallel
       differential equations such as with some convertible bond models.
