   //! Cash flow dependent on an index ratio.

   /*! This cash flow is not a coupon, i.e., there's no accrual.  The
       amount is either i(T)/i(0) or i(T)/i(0) - 1, depending on the
       growthOnly parameter.

       We expect this to be used inside an instrument that does all the date
       adjustment etc., so this takes just dates and does not change them.
       growthOnly = false means i(T)/i(0), which is a bond-type setting.
       growthOnly = true means i(T)/i(0) - 1, which is a swap-type setting.
