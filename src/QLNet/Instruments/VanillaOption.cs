      /*! \warning currently, this method returns the Black-Scholes
               implied volatility using analytic formulas for
               European options and a finite-difference method
               for American and Bermudan options. It will give
               unconsistent results if the pricing was performed
               with any other methods (such as jump-diffusion
               models.)

      \warning options with a gamma that changes sign (e.g.,
               binary options) have values that are <b>not</b>
               monotonic in the volatility. In these cases, the
               calculation can fail and the result (if any) is
               almost meaningless.  Another possible source of
               failure is to have a target value that is not
               attainable with any volatility, e.g., a target
               value lower than the intrinsic value in the case
               of American options.
