   //! %Forward contract on a fixed-rate bond
   /*! 1. valueDate refers to the settlement date of the bond forward
         contract.  maturityDate is the delivery (or repurchase)
         date for the underlying bond (not the bond's maturity
         date).

      2. Relevant formulas used in the calculations (\f$P\f$ refers
         to a price):

         a. \f$ P_{CleanFwd}(t) = P_{DirtyFwd}(t) -
           AI(t=deliveryDate) \f$ where \f$ AI \f$ refers to the
           accrued interest on the underlying bond.

         b. \f$ P_{DirtyFwd}(t) = \frac{P_{DirtySpot}(t) -
           SpotIncome(t)} {discountCurve->discount(t=deliveryDate)} \f$

         c. \f$ SpotIncome(t) = \sum_i \left( CF_i \times
           incomeDiscountCurve->discount(t_i) \right) \f$ where \f$
           CF_i \f$ represents the ith bond cash flow (coupon
           payment) associated with the underlying bond falling
           between the settlementDate and the deliveryDate. (Note
           the two different discount curves used in b. and c.)

      <b>Example: </b>
      \link Repo.cpp
      valuation of a repo on a fixed-rate bond
      \endlink

      \todo Add preconditions and tests

      \todo Create switch- if coupon goes to seller is toggled on,
           don't consider income in the \f$ P_{DirtyFwd}(t) \f$
           calculation.

      \todo Verify this works when the underlying is paper (in which
           case ignore all AI.)

      \warning This class still needs to be rigorously tested
