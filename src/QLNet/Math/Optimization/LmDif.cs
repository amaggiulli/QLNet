      *     subroutine lmdif
      *
      *     the purpose of lmdif is to minimize the sum of the squares of
      *     m nonlinear functions in n variables by a modification of
      *     the levenberg-marquardt algorithm. the user must provide a
      *     subroutine which calculates the functions. the jacobian is
      *     then calculated by a forward-difference approximation.
      *
      *     the subroutine statement is
      *
      *   subroutine lmdif(fcn,m,n,x,fvec,ftol,xtol,gtol,maxfev,epsfcn,
      *            diag,mode,factor,nprint,info,nfev,fjac,
      *            ldfjac,ipvt,qtf,wa1,wa2,wa3,wa4)
      *
      *     where
      *
      *   fcn is the name of the user-supplied subroutine which
      *     calculates the functions. fcn must be declared
      *     in an external statement in the user calling
      *     program, and should be written as follows.
      *
      *     subroutine fcn(m,n,x,fvec,iflag)
      *     integer m,n,iflag
      *     double precision x(n),fvec(m)
      *     ----------
      *     calculate the functions at x and
      *     return this vector in fvec.
      *     ----------
      *     return
      *     end
      *
      *     the value of iflag should not be changed by fcn unless
      *     the user wants to terminate execution of lmdif.
      *     in this case set iflag to a negative integer.
      *
      *   m is a positive integer input variable set to the number
      *     of functions.
      *
      *   n is a positive integer input variable set to the number
      *     of variables. n must not exceed m.
      *
      *   x is an array of length n. on input x must contain
      *     an initial estimate of the solution vector. on output x
      *     contains the final estimate of the solution vector.
      *
      *   fvec is an output array of length m which contains
      *     the functions evaluated at the output x.
      *
      *   ftol is a nonnegative input variable. termination
      *     occurs when both the actual and predicted relative
      *     reductions in the sum of squares are at most ftol.
      *     therefore, ftol measures the relative error desired
      *     in the sum of squares.
      *
      *   xtol is a nonnegative input variable. termination
      *     occurs when the relative error between two consecutive
      *     iterates is at most xtol. therefore, xtol measures the
      *     relative error desired in the approximate solution.
      *
      *   gtol is a nonnegative input variable. termination
      *     occurs when the cosine of the angle between fvec and
      *     any column of the jacobian is at most gtol in absolute
      *     value. therefore, gtol measures the orthogonality
      *     desired between the function vector and the columns
      *     of the jacobian.
      *
      *   maxfev is a positive integer input variable. termination
      *     occurs when the number of calls to fcn is at least
      *     maxfev by the end of an iteration.
      *
      *   epsfcn is an input variable used in determining a suitable
      *     step length for the forward-difference approximation. this
      *     approximation assumes that the relative errors in the
      *     functions are of the order of epsfcn. if epsfcn is less
      *     than the machine precision, it is assumed that the relative
      *     errors in the functions are of the order of the machine
      *     precision.
      *
      *   diag is an array of length n. if mode = 1 (see
      *     below), diag is internally set. if mode = 2, diag
      *     must contain positive entries that serve as
      *     multiplicative scale factors for the variables.
      *
      *   mode is an integer input variable. if mode = 1, the
      *     variables will be scaled internally. if mode = 2,
      *     the scaling is specified by the input diag. other
      *     values of mode are equivalent to mode = 1.
      *
      *   factor is a positive input variable used in determining the
      *     initial step bound. this bound is set to the product of
      *     factor and the euclidean norm of diag*x if nonzero, or else
      *     to factor itself. in most cases factor should lie in the
      *     interval (.1,100.). 100. is a generally recommended value.
      *
      *   nprint is an integer input variable that enables controlled
      *     printing of iterates if it is positive. in this case,
      *     fcn is called with iflag = 0 at the beginning of the first
      *     iteration and every nprint iterations thereafter and
      *     immediately prior to return, with x and fvec available
      *     for printing. if nprint is not positive, no special calls
      *     of fcn with iflag = 0 are made.
      *
      *   info is an integer output variable. if the user has
      *     terminated execution, info is set to the (negative)
      *     value of iflag. see description of fcn. otherwise,
      *     info is set as follows.
      *
      *     info = 0  improper input parameters.
      *
      *     info = 1  both actual and predicted relative reductions
      *           in the sum of squares are at most ftol.
      *
      *     info = 2  relative error between two consecutive iterates
      *           is at most xtol.
      *
      *     info = 3  conditions for info = 1 and info = 2 both hold.
      *
      *     info = 4  the cosine of the angle between fvec and any
      *           column of the jacobian is at most gtol in
      *           absolute value.
      *
      *     info = 5  number of calls to fcn has reached or
      *           exceeded maxfev.
      *
      *     info = 6  ftol is too small. no further reduction in
      *           the sum of squares is possible.
      *
      *     info = 7  xtol is too small. no further improvement in
      *           the approximate solution x is possible.
      *
      *     info = 8  gtol is too small. fvec is orthogonal to the
      *           columns of the jacobian to machine precision.
      *
      *   nfev is an integer output variable set to the number of
      *     calls to fcn.
      *
      *   fjac is an output m by n array. the upper n by n submatrix
      *     of fjac contains an upper triangular matrix r with
      *     diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude such that
      *
      *        t     t       t
      *       p *(jac *jac)*p = r *r,

      *     calculated jacobian. column j of p is column ipvt(j)
      *     (see below) of the identity matrix. the lower trapezoidal
      *     part of fjac contains information generated during
      *     the computation of r.
      *
      *   ldfjac is a positive integer input variable not less than m
      *     which specifies the leading dimension of the array fjac.
      *
      *   ipvt is an integer output array of length n. ipvt
      *     defines a permutation matrix p such that jac*p = q*r,
      *     where jac is the final calculated jacobian, q is
      *     orthogonal (not stored), and r is upper triangular
      *     with diagonal elements of nonincreasing magnitude.
      *     column j of p is column ipvt(j) of the identity matrix.
      *
      *   qtf is an output array of length n which contains
      *     the first n elements of the vector (q transpose)*fvec.
      *
      *   wa1, wa2, and wa3 are work arrays of length n.

      *     must contain the full upper triangle of the matrix r.
      *     on output the full upper triangle is unaltered, and the
      *     strict lower triangle contains the strict upper triangle
      *     (transposed) of the upper triangular matrix s.
      *
      *   ldr is a positive integer input variable not less than n
      *     which specifies the leading dimension of the array r.
      *
      *   ipvt is an integer input array of length n which defines the
      *     permutation matrix p such that a*p = q*r. column j of p
      *     is column ipvt(j) of the identity matrix.
      *
      *   diag is an input array of length n which must contain the
      *     diagonal elements of the matrix d.
      *
      *   qtb is an input array of length n which must contain the first
      *     n elements of the vector (q transpose)*b.
      *
      *   delta is a positive input variable which specifies an upper
      *     bound on the euclidean norm of d*x.
      *
      *   par is a nonnegative variable. on input par contains an
      *     initial estimate of the levenberg-marquardt parameter.
      *     on output par contains the final estimate.
      *
      *   x is an output array of length n which contains the least
      *     squares solution of the system a*x = b, sqrt(par)*d*x = 0,
      *     for the output par.
      *
      *   sdiag is an output array of length n which contains the
      *     diagonal elements of the upper triangular matrix s.
